We explore a combination of Recommender Systems
on the Movie Lens 20M dataset. A Collaborative Filtering
algorithm, two Content Based algorithms, a Hybrid strategy,
and Group Aggregation strategies are implemented. Each of
these algorithms have to be evaluated on a subset of the data
because of computational and time contraints, thus we had to
explore subsetting techniques. Fairness of the Collaborative
Filtering and Content Based algorithms are also explored
